**Authentication

Programs Used: 

bcryptjs: used to hash passwords before we store them in our database

body-parser: used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware

concurrently: allows us to run our backend and frontend concurrently and on different ports

express: sits on top of Node to make the routing, request handling, and responding easier to write

is-empty: global function that will come in handy when we use validator

jsonwebtoken: used for authorization. claims in a JWT
   are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
   Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
   signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) and/or encrypted.

mongoose: used to interact with MongoDB

passport: used to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. You provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.

passport-jwt: passport strategy for authenticating with a JSON Web Token (JWT); lets you authenticate endpoints using a JWT

validator: used to validate inputs (e.g. check for valid email format, confirming passwords match)

axios: promise based HTTP client for making requests to our backend

classnames: used for conditional classes in our JSX

jwt-decode: used to decode our jwt so we can get user data from it

react-redux: allows us to use Redux with React

react-router-dom: used for routing purposes

redux: used to manage state between components (can be used with React or any other view library)

redux-thunk: middleware for Redux that allows us to directly access the dispatch method to make asynchronous calls from our actions

***Add redux and react Chrome Extensions
